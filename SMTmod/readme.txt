All weapons are now Demons from Shin Megami Tensei.
All Demons use a specific spell with a damage type, Physical, Fire, Ice, Electric, or Force (can be seen by pressing Tab).
All enemies other than bosses are weak to and resist a damage type. 
A message will appear on screen indicating when an enemy is weak to or resists a damage type.
Killing 10 enemies levels you up, giving you +10 max hp and increasing the damage you do by 5 percent.
Press F1 to see your current level and maximum health (only visible after the first level up).
Press J to cycle through different armor equips. Press F1 to see which armor you have equipped (only visible after pressing J the first time). 
Neutral armor changes nothing, 
Attack armor increases your damage by 50 percent but you take 25 percent more damage, 
Defense armor decreases your damage by 50 percent but you take 25 percent less damage.
Type 'modhelp' into the console to see these instructions in game.
